Part 1"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><strong><em>Only takes 5 minutes to read!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AIA A101 is the standard form of agreement furnished by the American Institute of Architects which is used in generating well-defined business relationships between a Pand a contractor. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These contracts have been crafted, published, and promoted by a very influential and nationally renowned industry group.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Consequently, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the standardized version is designed to protect the interests of the contractor and can be protective of a contractor to the sometimes-costly detriment of the rights and flexibilities of the owner.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this often-inherent imbalance in the standard form agreement, negotiating contracts between owners and contractors requires a great deal of time and attention to detail. At Pierce &amp; Kwok, we regularly represent (in, to be clear, wholly separate deals) both owners and contractors, and so are able to fully understand the exposures and interests of both sides. Regardless of which side of the table you are on\u00a0if you do not make sure that your rights are protected, the standard agreements may not be advantageous to you in the event of a dispute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is essential that both owners, and even contractors, contact counsel to determine if the AIA contract at issue is protective of their interests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Require a Detailed Customized Agreement<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin, the standard form contract often fails to sufficiently define the term <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and, because construction is usually so multi-layered, it is necessary to provide thorough definitions each step of the way. Ultimately, the contract cannot practically describe every nail, piece of wood and joist utilized, so some inferences are necessary, but, the better the descriptions and definitions included, the safer all parties can feel about moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, let\u2019s say I am going to have a wall built. Several supports and joists will also be likely necessary. It&#8217;s reasonably inferable that included in this project will be all the labor, material, equipment, tools, supplies and scaffolding, etc., i.e. \u00a0everything one can expect is necessary to complete the job. But is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need a detailed agreement. Why? What happens if a dispute arises regarding an aspect of the work? Or its timing? Responsibility for shoddy work, or delay, must be strictly delineated.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Determine Dates<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always include commencement and deadline dates. The contractor should advise the owner of any inconsistencies in the contract documents, as well as clarify the order of precedence of the staging of each step of the construction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be occasional conflicts or inconsistencies. If there are, clarification is necessary and must be supplied by the Contractor. Otherwise, they&#8217;re able to take the path of least resistance, accomplishing easiest tasks first, even if practicality or logic dictate otherwise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Department of Buildings (DOB) and Permits<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, be clear as to who is responsible for applying for and acquiring the permits. Sometimes the contract will say, &#8220;Contractor will work only pursuant to all the legal and necessary permits required by the state, federal, and municipal law.&#8221; Who has to secure those permits? Someone has to actually go get them. You want to make sure that the contractor is responsible. If not the contractor, then the architect, but it <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be pre-determined. The owner should <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">never<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have to go suffer through the Kafkian void that is New York City\u2019s Department of Buildings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In part two, we will continue the discussion on these agreements.
