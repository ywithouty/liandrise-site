Section 50&nbsp;provides criminal penalties and&nbsp;section 51&nbsp;provides a private right of action for\ndamages and injunctive relief.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based only on a plain reading of the\nstatute, one might reasonably conclude that writing a book about the life of the\nneighborhood bodega owner, without his consent, however intriguing it may be,\nwould be a violation of the statute. One might also determine that, whereas\nwriting a book about a local small business owner violates the statute and said\nowners right of publicity (which is a subset of the right to privacy), writing\na book or making a movie about, say, Taylor Swift, would not be in violation\nbecause Taylor Swift is a public figure. Neither assumption is entirely accurate\naccording to New York courts\u2019 interpretation of the Law, however, creating\nambiguities as to what\u2019s protected, here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creative works, a term derived from copyright law, which\nincludes plays, movies, short stories, songs, dances, visual arts, and the\nlike, are protected forms of free speech under the First Amendment of the U.S.\nConstitution. Accordingly, as between a state statute and the Constitution, the\nFirst Amendment will most often prevail.<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason creative works are found not to violate the Law is that courts have construed the statute as exempting them because they are not &#8220;advertising&#8221; or &#8220;trade.&#8221; The case of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Gravano v. Take-Two Interactive Software<\/span>, Inc., 37 N.Y.S.3d 20 (N.Y. App. Div. 2016) clearly illustrates this. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Gravano<\/span> involves a challenge by one-time celebrity <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lindsay_Lohan\">Lindsay Lohan<\/a> to the use of her image in a <a href=\"https:\/\/sl.sbs.com.au\/public\/image\/file\/be336965-1faa-4c77-91de-e3326c723ab1\">video game<\/a>. The court made short shrift of the case in ruling against Lohan. It held that the video game was protected expressive speech and cited <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Brown v Entertainment Merchants Assn.<\/span>, 564 US 786, 790 [2011] &nbsp;for the proposition that &#8220;(l)ike the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas&#8221; and deserve First Amendment protection.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,\nthere is even a limit to the protection afforded creative works or expressive\nspeech under the First Amendment. In New York, the expressive work must not\nsubstantially fictionalize the incidents ascribed to the person whose persona\nis being appropriated, otherwise, the expressive work will not be protected.\nThe Court of Appeals has held\nthat statutory liability applies to a materially and &#8220;substantially\nfictitious biography&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/advance.lexis.com\/document\/?pdmfid=1000516&amp;crid=fca5d552-a6b5-4df4-83ad-05a626fd1dbb&amp;pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5MY4-3VN1-F04J-70M5-00000-00&amp;pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A5MY4-3VN1-F04J-70M5-00000-00&amp;pdcontentcomponentid=9092&amp;pdshepid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A5MYF-MP61-DXC8-70PS-00000-00&amp;pdteaserkey=sr2&amp;pditab=allpods&amp;ecomp=Ly_fk&amp;earg=sr2&amp;prid=2a156f2e-f13e-4efe-8672-9d2bb0f9e9c4\">Spahn v Julian Messner, Inc., 18 NY2d 324, 329,\n221 NE2d 543, 274 NYS2d 877 [1966]<\/a>,&nbsp;<em>vacated<\/em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/advance.lexis.com\/document\/?pdmfid=1000516&amp;crid=fca5d552-a6b5-4df4-83ad-05a626fd1dbb&amp;pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5MY4-3VN1-F04J-70M5-00000-00&amp;pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A5MY4-3VN1-F04J-70M5-00000-00&amp;pdcontentcomponentid=9092&amp;pdshepid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A5MYF-MP61-DXC8-70PS-00000-00&amp;pdteaserkey=sr2&amp;pditab=allpods&amp;ecomp=Ly_fk&amp;earg=sr2&amp;prid=2a156f2e-f13e-4efe-8672-9d2bb0f9e9c4\">387 US 239, 87 S Ct 1706, 18 L Ed 2d 744 [1967]<\/a>,&nbsp;<em>adhered to on remand and rearg<\/em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/advance.lexis.com\/document\/?pdmfid=1000516&amp;crid=fca5d552-a6b5-4df4-83ad-05a626fd1dbb&amp;pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5MY4-3VN1-F04J-70M5-00000-00&amp;pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A5MY4-3VN1-F04J-70M5-00000-00&amp;pdcontentcomponentid=9092&amp;pdshepid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A5MYF-MP61-DXC8-70PS-00000-00&amp;pdteaserkey=sr2&amp;pditab=allpods&amp;ecomp=Ly_fk&amp;earg=sr2&amp;prid=2a156f2e-f13e-4efe-8672-9d2bb0f9e9c4\">21 NY2d 124, 233 NE2d 840, 286 NYS2d 832 [1967]<\/a>,&nbsp;<em>appeal dismissed<\/em>&nbsp;393 US 1046, 89 S Ct 676, 21\nL Ed 2d 600 [1969])&nbsp;where a\n&#8220;knowing fictionalization&#8221; amounts to an &#8220;all-pervasive&#8221;\nuse of imaginary incidents and a biography that is &#8220;nothing more than [an]\nattempt[ ] to trade on the persona.&#8221; Id.; <em>see\ngenerally<\/em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/advance.lexis.com\/document\/?pdmfid=1000516&amp;crid=fca5d552-a6b5-4df4-83ad-05a626fd1dbb&amp;pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5MY4-3VN1-F04J-70M5-00000-00&amp;pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A5MY4-3VN1-F04J-70M5-00000-00&amp;pdcontentcomponentid=9092&amp;pdshepid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A5MYF-MP61-DXC8-70PS-00000-00&amp;pdteaserkey=sr2&amp;pditab=allpods&amp;ecomp=Ly_fk&amp;earg=sr2&amp;prid=2a156f2e-f13e-4efe-8672-9d2bb0f9e9c4\">Lerman v Flynt Distrib. Co., Inc., 745 F2d 123,\n131-132 (2d Cir 1984)<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In New York, closely related to the First Amendment, are the newsworthiness and matter of public interest exceptions to the Law. As to what constitutes matters of public interest, the definition is nebulous and broad. It includes political happenings, social trends, news stories, and articles of consumer interest, including developments in the fashion world. Also included are \u201call types of factual, educational and historical data, or even entertainment and amusement, concerning interesting phases of human activity in general.&#8221;<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a>On the other hand, matters that are not considered public interest include stories which fall &#8220;into the realm of mere gossip and prurient interest,&#8221;<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]<\/a> or are &#8220;matters of purely private concern.&#8221;<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]<\/a> In <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Stephano v News Group Publs<\/span>., 64 NY2d 174 (1984), &nbsp;the Court of Appeals ruled against the plaintiff and stated, \u201cIt is the content of the article and not the defendant&#8217;s motive or primary motive to increase circulation which determines whether it is a newsworthy item\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other exception to the\nLaw exists for incidental or <em>de minimis<\/em> violations, which mostly applies\nto photographers. The\ndoctrine of incidental relationship holds that a person, whose images are\nincidentally included in a photograph without her consent, and who is not the\nmain focus of the photo, is also without remedy if the subject of the photo is\na matter of public interest or newsworthy.<a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]<\/a>\nMoreover, if the person is included in a video, and their appearance is brief\nor <em>de minimis<\/em>, her appearance will be\ndeemed incidental and no privacy violation will be found.<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]<\/a>\nIncidental use will be found if there is close proximity in an&nbsp;&nbsp;\u201cassessment of the\nrelationship of the references to a particular individual \u2018to the main purpose\nand subject of the [work in issue].\u2019&#8221;<a href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Spahn<\/span> stands for the proposition that you can author a creative work about someone, but you must ensure that the creative work is not a substantial fictionalization of that person&#8217;s life, otherwise you subject yourself to statutory liability. The case of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Porco v. Lifetime Entm&#8217;t Servs.,<\/span> LLC, 47 N.Y.S.3d 769 (N.Y. App. Div. 2017) demonstrates the blurry line a content creator must straddle between substantial fictionalization, dramatic license, and an accurate recount of real-life events; a case whose trial court ruling initially sent off alarm bells in the true crime, docu-series, biopic industry of video and film making. Because courts conclude that if the expressive work is substantially fictionalized, it loses its newsworthiness or public interest value, thereby losing its safe harbor protections under the Law. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Spahn<\/span> rationale seems to conflict or be inconsistent with the ruling in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Gravano<\/span>. In <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Gravano<\/span>, the argument by the content creator wasn\u2019t so much that Lohan was newsworthy, as it was that the video game was an inherently protected form of free speech. And decidedly, it was the free speech argument that prevailed. (\u201cEven if we accept plaintiffs&#8217; contentions that the video game depictions are close enough to be considered representations of the respective plaintiffs, plaintiffs&#8217; claims should be dismissed because this video game does not fall under the statutory definitions of \u201cadvertising\u201d or \u201ctrade\u201d\u2026 This video game&#8217;s unique story, characters, dialogue, and environment, combined with the player&#8217;s ability to choose how to proceed in the game, render it a work of fiction\u201d)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Porco<\/span> creates even more ambiguity for content creators. In <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Porco<\/span>, the plaintiff, Porco, is imprisoned, convicted for the murder of his father and the attempted murder of his mother. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mylifetime.com\/lmn\/shows\">Lifetime Television Network<\/a> was set to air a docudrama about his life. Porco objected to the film because his mother received a letter from the film\u2019s producer which, based on an extremely favorable reading of the letter in favor of Porco, ostensibly suggested that the producers of the docudrama had fictionalized it, since the letter offered the plaintiff\u2019s mother an opportunity to set the record straight. The appeals court, in reversing the trial court which granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, ruled that it was plausible for one to conclude that the film was not an accurate account of the record and was merely intended to be a fictionalized portrayal of Porco\u2019s life. The court cited <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Spahn<\/span> for the proposition that &#8220;a work may be so infected with fiction, dramatization or embellishment that it cannot be said to fulfill the purpose of the newsworthiness exception.&#8221; The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Porco<\/span> case is currently pending, and its eventual outcome will be of great importance to the entertainment industry and New York\u2019s right of publicity jurisprudence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sum, right of\npublicity laws vary across the country. Therefore, content creators should know\nthe laws of each state in which their creative work will be distributed,\nreproduced, broadcast, or displayed. As a general rule, in New York, creative\nworks that feature persons without their consent, but which are newsworthy, of\npublic interest, or that incidentally appropriate such persons\u2019 persona, will\nnot violate the Law. Still, creators must be mindful not to substantially\nfictionalize the life of persons who are the subject of such works, or else the\nworks and their creators will end up on the wrong side of the Law.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> <em>See, generally<\/em> Zacchini v.
