We use the information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. We don\u2019t share any of the information you provide with others, unless we say so in this Privacy Policy, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>User-supplied information<\/strong>: If you fill out the contact form on this website, we will ask you to provide some personal information (such as e-mail address, name, phone number and state). We only require that you provide an e-mail address on the contact form. Further, if chat is available through this site, you may be asked to provide information if you participate in an online chat. Please do not submit any confidential, proprietary or sensitive personally identifiable information (e.g. Social Security Number; date of birth; drivers license number; or credit card, bank account or other financial information) (collectively, \u201cSensitive Information\u201d). If you submit any Sensitive Information, you do so at your own risk and we will not be liable to you or responsible for consequences of your submission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information that you provide to us through the contact form or an online chat will be used so that we may respond to your inquiry.
